# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

## ADR-001: Template Method Pattern for Command Execution

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-01-12  
**Deciders**: Development Team  

### Context
Commands in the CLI needed consistent behavior for:
- Error handling and user feedback
- Performance tracking and monitoring
- Lifecycle hooks for pre/post processing
- Spinner management for long-running operations

Without a consistent pattern, each command implemented these concerns differently, leading to:
- Code duplication across commands
- Inconsistent error messages and user experience
- No centralized performance monitoring
- Difficult testing due to scattered error handling

### Decision
Implement the Template Method pattern through a `CommandBase` abstract class that defines the execution skeleton with customizable hooks.

**Template method structure**:
```typescript
private async executeWithErrorHandling(args: any[], options: any): Promise<void> {
  this.performanceTracker = performanceMonitor.startTracking(this.command.name());
  
  try {
    await this.preExecute(args, options);    // Hook
    await this.execute(args, options);       // Abstract - subclass implements
    await this.postExecute(args, options);   // Hook
    
    this.performanceTracker.end(true);
  } catch (error) {
    this.performanceTracker?.end(false, error.message);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

### Consequences

**Positive**:
- ✅ Eliminates boilerplate code in command implementations
- ✅ Consistent error handling and user feedback across all commands
- ✅ Automatic performance tracking for all operations
- ✅ Easy to add cross-cutting concerns (logging, metrics, etc.)
- ✅ Improved testability through consistent structure
- ✅ Better maintainability - fix once, benefits all commands

**Negative**:
- ❌ Requires inheritance, which can be less flexible than composition
- ❌ New developers need to understand the template method pattern
- ❌ Potential for subclasses to break contract if hooks are misused

**Neutral**:
- Migration required for existing commands (handled incrementally)
- Additional abstraction layer increases learning curve slightly

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Composition with Command Wrapper**: Decided against due to more complex API
2. **Middleware Pattern**: Too heavy for this use case
3. **Decorator Pattern Only**: Insufficient for lifecycle management

## ADR-002: Custom Dependency Injection Container

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-01-12  
**Deciders**: Development Team  

### Context
The CLI needed to abstract browser operations for:
- Easy mocking in tests
- Potential future support for different browser engines
- Cleaner separation between command logic and browser implementation

Existing `BrowserHelper` static methods were tightly coupled and difficult to mock, making unit testing challenging.

### Decision
Implement a custom, lightweight dependency injection container with service interfaces.

**Key components**:
- `IBrowserService` interface for browser operations
- `DIContainer` class for service registration/resolution
- `MockBrowserService` for testing
- `BrowserHelperAdapter` to wrap existing functionality

### Consequences

**Positive**:
- ✅ Easy mocking for comprehensive unit tests
- ✅ Loose coupling between commands and browser implementation
- ✅ No external dependencies (keeps bundle small)
- ✅ Service substitution without code changes
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns

**Negative**:
- ❌ Additional complexity for simple use cases
- ❌ Less feature-rich than mature DI libraries (e.g., no auto-wiring)
- ❌ Manual service registration required

**Neutral**:
- Custom implementation means we maintain it ourselves
- Simple enough to understand and modify as needed

### Alternatives Considered

1. **InversifyJS**: Too heavy for our needs, adds significant bundle size
2. **TSyringe**: Microsoft library but still external dependency
3. **Manual Factory Functions**: Considered but DI container provides better structure

## ADR-003: Strategy Pattern with Circuit Breaker for Retry Logic

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-01-12  
**Deciders**: Development Team  

### Context
Browser automation operations can fail for various transient reasons:
- Network connectivity issues
- Browser not responding
- Page elements not ready
- Resource loading delays

Different operations need different retry behaviors:
- Browser connections: Longer delays, more attempts
- UI interactions: Shorter delays, fewer attempts
- Network requests: Variable delays based on error type

### Decision
Implement Strategy pattern for retry logic with built-in circuit breaker functionality.

**Strategy hierarchy**:
- Abstract `RetryStrategy` base class with circuit breaker logic
- `ExponentialRetryStrategy` for exponential backoff
- `LinearRetryStrategy` for linear delay increase
- `FixedRetryStrategy` for consistent delays
- `RetryStrategyFactory` for strategy creation

**Circuit breaker features**:
- Opens after 3 consecutive failures
- Auto-resets to half-open after 30 seconds
- Prevents cascading failures

### Consequences

**Positive**:
- ✅ Different retry behaviors for different operation types
- ✅ Circuit breaker prevents resource exhaustion
- ✅ Comprehensive metrics for monitoring and debugging
- ✅ Easy to add new retry strategies
- ✅ Configurable per operation type

**Negative**:
- ❌ Added complexity for simple operations that rarely fail
- ❌ Circuit breaker state management adds memory overhead
- ❌ Multiple strategy types increase API surface area

**Neutral**:
- Provides foundation for future reliability improvements
- Metrics collection enables data-driven optimization

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Simple Exponential Backoff**: Too rigid for different operation types
2. **External Retry Library**: Adds dependency and may not fit our needs
3. **No Retry Logic**: Unacceptable for production reliability

## ADR-004: Decorator Pattern for Parameter Validation

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-01-12  
**Deciders**: Development Team  

### Context
Command parameters require extensive validation:
- URLs must be properly formatted
- Ports must be valid numbers in range
- Selectors must not be empty
- Enum values must be from allowed sets
- Security: input sanitization to prevent injection

Manual validation in each command leads to:
- Code duplication and inconsistency
- Easy to forget validation steps
- Inconsistent error messages
- No centralized sanitization

### Decision
Implement Decorator pattern with Chain of Responsibility for parameter validation.

**Key components**:
- Parameter decorators: `@ValidateUrl()`, `@ValidateSelector()`, etc.
- Method decorator: `@validateParams` processes validation chain
- Validation utilities: `ValidationUtils`, `Validators`
- Sanitization: `Sanitizers` for input cleaning

**Validation chain**:
```typescript
protected async execute(
  @ValidateUrl(true) url: string,
  @ValidatePort() port: string
): Promise<void> {
  // Parameters automatically validated before this method runs
}
```

### Consequences

**Positive**:
- ✅ Declarative validation rules - easy to read and maintain
- ✅ Composable validators - mix and match as needed
- ✅ Automatic error handling with consistent messages
- ✅ Built-in input sanitization prevents security issues
- ✅ Centralized validation logic reduces duplication

**Negative**:
- ❌ Requires understanding of TypeScript decorators
- ❌ Debugging can be more complex due to decorator magic
- ❌ Decorator metadata can be tricky with TypeScript compilation

**Neutral**:
- Fluent API allows building complex validation chains
- Can be extended with custom validators

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Manual Validation**: Too much duplication and error-prone
2. **Schema Validation (Zod/Joi)**: External dependency, different patterns
3. **Class-validator**: Decorator-based but focused on class properties

- Structured JSON logging for analysis

### Decision
Implement structured logging using Winston with custom formatters.

**Features**:
- Multiple transports (console + optional file)
- Environment-based log level control
- Colored console output for readability
- JSON file format for structured analysis
- Convenience methods for common scenarios

### Consequences

**Positive**:
- ✅ Professional logging with industry-standard library
- ✅ Configurable log levels via environment variables
- ✅ Colored output improves CLI user experience
- ✅ File logging aids debugging and support
- ✅ Structured JSON format enables log analysis

**Negative**:
- ❌ External dependency (Winston + related packages)
- ❌ Slightly larger bundle size
- ❌ More complex than simple console.log

**Neutral**:
- Gradual migration from console.log statements
- Standard patterns that developers expect

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Pino**: Faster but less ecosystem support
2. **Custom Logger**: Would need to implement all features ourselves
3. **Debug Library**: Too simple for production logging needs
