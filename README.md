- ðŸš€ **Auto-launch Chrome** if not running
- ðŸŽ­ **Full Playwright API** via simple commands
- ðŸ’¾ **Session persistence** - reconnect to previous sessions
- ðŸŽ¯ **Smart detection** - automatically finds and connects to browsers

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/playwright-cli
cd playwright-cli

# Install dependencies (with pnpm, npm, or bun)

## Usage

### Quick Start

```bash
# Connect to Chrome (auto-launches if not running)
playwright connect

# Start a Playwright-managed browser
playwright start

# Navigate to a URL
playwright navigate https://google.com

# Take a screenshot
playwright screenshot output.png

# Execute JavaScript
playwright eval "document.title"

# Click an element
playwright click "button.submit"

## Integration with Claude Code

This CLI can be integrated with Claude Code using hooks. Write code to `/dev/playwright` to execute it in the connected browser:

```javascript
// In Claude Code, write to /dev/playwright/script.js
await page.goto('https://example.com')
const title = await page.title()
console.log(title)
```

## Architecture

- **TypeScript + Bun** for fast execution
- **Commander.js** for CLI structure
- **Playwright** for browser automation
- **Session persistence** for reconnection
- **Auto-detection** of Chrome instances
