- üóÇÔ∏è **Tab management** - Control multiple tabs with `--tab-id` or `--tab-index`
- üíæ **Session persistence** - Save and restore browser sessions
- üöÄ **LLM-friendly** - Designed for AI agents and automation workflows

## Installation

### Easy Installation (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/playwright-cli
cd playwright-cli

# Interactive installation (auto-detects best location)
./install.sh
# - If ~/.local/bin is in PATH: installs there (no sudo)
# - Otherwise: asks if you want system-wide (/usr/local/bin with sudo) 
#   or user-local (add to PATH manually)

# Force user directory installation (no sudo, may need PATH setup)
PLAYWRIGHT_SYSTEM_INSTALL=false ./install.sh

# Force system-wide installation (requires sudo, works immediately)
PLAYWRIGHT_SYSTEM_INSTALL=true ./install.sh
```

**Important:** For the `playwright` command to work, the binary must be in your PATH. The installer will guide you if PATH setup is needed.

### Manual Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies (with pnpm, npm, or bun)
pnpm install  # Recommended
# or: npm install
# or: bun install

# Build the project

# Install Playwright browsers (optional, for managed browsers)
pnpm exec playwright install chromium
# or: npx playwright install chromium
```

### Windows Installation

```powershell
# Run PowerShell as Administrator (optional, for system-wide install)
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/playwright-cli
cd playwright-cli

# Run the installer

```

## Usage

### Quick Start

```bash
# Open browser and navigate to a URL
playwright open https://google.com

# Navigate to a URL in existing browser
playwright navigate https://example.com

# Take a screenshot
playwright screenshot output.png

# Execute JavaScript
playwright eval "document.title"

# Click an element
playwright click "button.submit"

# Type text
playwright type "#search-input" "Hello World"

# Fill form fields (enhanced syntax)
playwright fill "email=user@example.com" "password=secret123"
```

### Browser & Tab Management

```bash

# Close specific tab
playwright tabs close --tab-id ABC123

# Switch to specific tab
playwright tabs select --index 2
```

### Page Navigation

```bash
# Navigate to URL
playwright navigate https://example.com

# Navigate back in history
playwright back

# Wait for element or timeout
playwright wait ".loaded-content" --timeout 5000
```

### Interaction Commands

```bash
# Click element (supports CSS selectors or text matching)
playwright click "Submit"  # Clicks button with text "Submit"
playwright click "#submit-btn"  # CSS selector
playwright click --ref abc123  # Using captured ref

# Type text
playwright type "#input" "text"
playwright type --ref xyz789 "text"  # Using ref

# Fill multiple form fields
playwright fill "username=john" "email=john@example.com" "password=secret"
playwright fill "#name" "John Doe"  # Legacy syntax still supported

# Select dropdown option
playwright select "#country" "USA"

# Hover over element
playwright hover ".menu-item"

# Drag and drop
playwright drag ".draggable" ".drop-zone"

# Press keyboard key
playwright press "Enter"

# Upload files
playwright upload "#file-input" document.pdf photo.jpg
```

### Capture & Analysis

```bash
# Take screenshot
playwright screenshot [filename]
playwright screenshot --full-page  # Full page screenshot

# Save as PDF
playwright pdf output.pdf

# Capture interactive elements snapshot
playwright snapshot  # Shows all interactive elements with refs
playwright snapshot --full  # Include all elements
playwright snapshot --json  # Output as JSON

# Show current page context and state
playwright context  # Shows page info, forms, navigation state, persistent action history
playwright context --verbose  # Include technical details
playwright context --json  # Output as JSON

# Enhanced text-based element selection
playwright click "Submit"  # Click button with text "Submit"
playwright type "Enter your email" "user@example.com"  # Type in input by placeholder
playwright fill "Password=secret123"  # Fill by label text

# List all open pages
playwright list
```

### Session Management

```bash
# Save current session
playwright session save my-session

# Load saved session
playwright session load my-session

# List saved sessions
playwright session list
```

### Tab Targeting

Most interaction commands support tab targeting via:
- `--tab-id <id>` - Target specific tab by ID
- `--tab-index <n>` - Target tab by index (0-based)

```bash
# Examples
playwright click "#button" --tab-id ABC123DEF
playwright type "#input" "text" --tab-index 2
playwright screenshot --tab-id XYZ789
```

## Architecture

- **TypeScript + Yargs** - Type-safe CLI with automatic help generation
- **Playwright Core** - Browser automation engine
- **Chrome DevTools Protocol** - Direct browser control
- **Action History** - Tracks user interactions for context
- **Ref System** - Capture and reuse element references
- **Session Persistence** - Save and restore browser state

## Development

```bash
# Run in development mode
npm run dev

# Build the project
npm run build

# Run tests
npm test

# Run specific test suite
npm run test:unit
npm run test:integration
npm run test:e2e

# Build standalone executable (requires Bun)
bun build src/index.ts --compile --outfile playwright-cli
```

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive test coverage:
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for command workflows
- E2E tests for full browser automation scenarios
- Backward compatibility tests

Run tests with:
```bash
npm test           # Run all tests
npm run test:watch # Watch mode
npm run test:ui    # Interactive UI
```

**Note:** Tests run with a visible browser window (not headless) due to limitations with Playwright's CDP connection to headless Chrome. This is a known issue where `connectOverCDP` doesn't work reliably with externally-launched headless Chrome instances.
