### BREAKING CHANGES

* All tests now use real browser execution instead of mocks

## Summary
- Migrated all 31 command test files from mocks to real CLI execution
- Implemented comprehensive tab ID management system
- Achieved 100% test pass rate (183 tests passing)

## Key Changes

### Test Infrastructure
- Added TabManager utility class for centralized tab ID management
- Implemented global test setup/teardown for browser session management
- Created helper functions to extract and track tab IDs from command output

### Command Updates
- Added --tab-id and --tab-index parameters to all relevant commands
- Fixed missing error handling in select, wait, and session commands
- Updated all commands to return "Tab ID: XXXX" for tab tracking

### Test Conversions (31 files)
- Navigation (7): open, navigate, back, wait, tabs, close, open.real
- Interaction (8): click, type, press, fill, select, hover, drag, upload
- Capture (5): screenshot, pdf, snapshot, resize, list
- Advanced (6): console, dialog, eval, exec, network, perf
- Utility (5): session, claude, codegen, install, test

### Results
- 183 total tests passing
- 100% real browser execution with execSync
- Zero mocks remaining in command tests
- Proper tab cleanup using specific IDs only
